It allows computational models composed of multiple layers to learn and represent data with multiple levels of abstraction, mimicking the human brain, thereby helping to decipher patterns and structures in data. Deep learning techniques have been widely applied in several industries and fields such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and more, offering solutions for image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and various other complex tasks.\", \n",

    "          \"The power of deep learning lies in its ability to automatically extract features from raw data. Traditional machine learning models require manual feature engineering, where the relevant features are extracted before applying the model. However, with deep learning, the model learns these features itself from the data, which reduces the need for human intervention. This aspect of deep learning has made it an integral part of many modern artificial intelligence systems.\", \n",

These layers are interconnected through nodes, or neurons, with each node in a layer connecting to each node in the next layer. The depth of these layers is where deep learning gets its name - 'deep' refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed.\", \n",

    "Now, you can use the persistence diagram to inform your choice of parameters for DBSCAN. In particular, the `eps` parameter of DBSCAN is similar to the persistence of homological features: increasing `eps` will cause more points to be included in the same cluster, similar to how increasing the persistence will cause more features to be included in the homology. Thus, you might choose `eps` to be slightly larger than the largest persistence of a significant feature. However, keep in mind that this is just a heuristic and may not always give the best results."

    "Note that `Cluster 1: [4]` is indeed a bit of an outlier in terms of content, speaking more about healthcare than deep learning. So it seems fitting that it gets its own cluster. Notice also that each of `text_1[18], text_1[19], text_1[20], text_1[21], text_1[22], text_1[23], text_1[24]` should probably be in there own clusters. So, this method, while better than the others, is not perfect either. One way we might alleviate this is by performing this analysis for each head in each layer of the model. Then, we have several options. We could compute the Fréchet mean diagram of each `text_1[i]` across all heads of the model, and then run the above analysis on the Fréchet mean diagrams. We might also look at the clusters formed across all of the attention heads in the above way and use a method for choosing the best ones, such as simply choosing the one with the bext silhouette coefficient. There are of course more advanced options as well. "
